My name is Scott Gaines, and I am currently enrolled as a student at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) for Front-End Software Development (anticipating a January 2023 graduation!) I am interested in fostering technology and user-experiences that result in a lasting impact, support for disenfranchised communities and demographics, and a furthering of the arts and education.
